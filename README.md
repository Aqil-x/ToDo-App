# ToDo-App
This is my simlpe to do app using python.
A simple command-line To-Do List application written in Python.
It allows users to add tasks, view tasks, remove tasks, and store all tasks in an external text file.
This project is beginner-friendly and demonstrates file handling and list management in Python.

Features
Add new tasks
Remove existing tasks
Display all tasks with numbering
Tasks are saved in an external file
Tasks load automatically when program starts
Clean and easy-to-understand structure

ow It Works
All tasks are stored in an external text file (tasks.txt)
When the program starts, it loads tasks from the file
Tasks can be added, removed, or viewed
When a change is made, it is saved back to the file

What I Learned
How to read and write to external files in Python
How to store tasks inside a list
String manipulation (strip())
Using loops and conditionals
Basic program design and menu systems
